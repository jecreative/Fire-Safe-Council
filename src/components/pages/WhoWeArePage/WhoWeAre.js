            San Diego County has been home to three of the ten largest fires in
            California. The 2003 Cedar Fire is still the largest single fire in
            the nation, and the 2007 wildfires created the largest evacuation in
            our nationâ€™s history. Wildfires not only destroy life and property,
            but also damage our air, watersheds, wildlife habitat, health, and
            our quality of life.
            <br />
            <br />
            Helping San Diego residents prevent, prepare for, and deal with the
            aftermath of these devastating wildfires is the goal of the Fire
            Safe Council of San Diego County. Through our programs and our
            support of community Fire Safe Councils, we are committed to making
            San Diego fire safe.
            <br />

            The Fire Safe Council of San Diego County was formed in 1997 as a
            nonprofit corporation (501c3) in the state of California through a
            collaboration between the Resource Conservation District of Greater
            San Diego County (RCD), along with local, state, federal, and tribal
            fire agency partners. The RCD manages the programs and the funds for
            the Fire Safe Council of San Diego County.
